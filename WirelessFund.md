# Wireless Fundamentals

Standard for Wireless LAN: 802.11

## Wireless Network Issues
- All devices within range receive all frames, like devices connected to an Ethernet hub.
    - Privacy of data within the LAN is a greater concern.
    - CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) is used to facilitate half-duplex communications. A device will wait for others to transmit before transmitting itself.
    - CSMA/CD is for wired networks.
- Wireless communications are regulated by various international and national bodies.
- Wireless signal coverage area must be considered.
    - Signal range.
    - Signal absorption: passing through material weakens signal
    - reflection: signal bounces off metal surfaces
    - refraction: waves are bent when passing through different materials.
    - diffraction:travels around obstacle
    - scattering: scatters signal in various signals
- Other devices using the same channels can cause interference.
    - For example, a wireless LAN in your neighbor’s house/apartment.

## Radio Frequency
- To send wireless signals, the sender applies an alternating current to an antenna.
→This creates electromagnetic fields which propagate out as waves.
- Electromagnetic waves can be measured in multiple ways for example amplitude and 
frequency.
- Amplitude is the maximum strength of the electric and magnetic fields.
-  Frequency measures the number of up/down cycles per a given unit of time.
- The most common measurement of frequency is hertz.
→ Hz (Hertz) = cycles per second
→ kHz (Kilohertz) = 1,000 cycles per second
- Another important term is period, the amount of time of one cycle.
→ If the frequency is 4 Hz, the period is 0.25 seconds.`
