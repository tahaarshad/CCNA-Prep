# Wide Area Network
## Logical Topologies
- Point-to-point : dedicated leased line
- Hub and Spoke : Multiple spoke router connected through a single hub router.
- Dual Homed : Hub and Spoke but with 2 hub routers for redundancy
- Fully Meshed: all routers connected to each other
- Paritally meshed: not all sites are connected to each other

## Carrier Connections
How an organization connects to the internet as specified in the SLA.
- Single carrier: connect to one service provider
- Dual Carrier: seperate slas with different service providers

## Evolution
Small > campus > branch > distributed

## WAN Standards
Managed by 3 organization:
- TIA/EIA - Telecommunications Industry Association and Electronic Industries Alliance
- ISO - International Organization for Standardization
- IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

## OSI Model
Layer 1 Optical Fiber Standards
- Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)
- Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET)
- Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)

Layer 2 Protocols
Broadband (i.e., DSL and Cable)
Wireless
Ethernet WAN (Metro Ethernet)
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) (less used)
High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) (less used)
Frame Relay (legacy)
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) (legacy)
