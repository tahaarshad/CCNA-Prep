## Network Fundamentals

### Routers
Enables interconnection between networks.

**Useful Commands**
`show ip route`
shows all routes.
**(S*)** means static - manually configured.

### Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switches
Enables intterconnection between devices inside a network.

Switches reside in Layer-2 but Layer-3 switches also possess routing capabilities.

**Useful Commands**
`show mac address-table`
shows all connected devices.

### Next Generation Firewalls and IPS
These are secuirty appliances that inspect network traffic enforce network security policies in order to protect the network from threats.
Next Gen FW reside in Layer 7.
They perform deep packet inspection that can be useful in tasks such as viewing bandwidth usage.

IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) - A proactive system that detects and responds to threats. Can even inspect encrypted traffic.

IPS Sensors - A standalone appliance.

### Access Points
Enable wireless devices to gain access to a wired network or the internet.
*Mesh Wireless LAN* - Receives a signal and regenerates it for broadccast.

**A wireless LAN controller is configured to manage multiple access points.** - WLC

### Endpoint and Servers
Endpoint devices request for services whereas servers provide services
(Client-server and peer-to-peer architecture)

### Cisco DNA Center
Cisco's centralized network management and orchestration tool. It uses AI and machine learning to proactively manage and troubleshoot network issues.
Design, add, configure, monitor, troubleshoot, assurance, policy, provision.

### Explain virtualization fundamentals (server virtualization, containers, and VRFs)
This technology allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single physical hardware system. It's used to optimize resource usage and create flexible and scalable network architectures.
